India's <b>tropical paradise</b> is Goa. The stunning Western Ghats of India, a large mountain range and a treasure trove of <b>biodiversity</b>, enclose around 20% of the territory of Goa. Indian giant squirrels, mongooses, slender lorises, Indian macaques, and sloth bears are just a few of the unique animals that may be found in these jungles.
